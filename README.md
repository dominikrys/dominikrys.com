Available at: **[dominikrys.com](https://dominikrys.com/)**

## Notes

- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

  - Website deployed from the `docs` folder. This has the benefits of keeping the generated website and the raw markdown in one repo. Currently only deployments from the `docs` directory and root [are supported by GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
