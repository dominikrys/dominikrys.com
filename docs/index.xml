      <description>Intro A couple of months ago I wrote a CHIP-8 emulator in C++17 as I wanted to learn about emulation and expand my C++ knowledge outside of work. You can check out the source code or try it out online through the magic of WebAssembly.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I went about compiling the emulator which was designed to run natively on Windows and Linux, to also run on the web using WebAssembly.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dom. Welcome to my first blog post!
My main objective for this blog is to start documenting my work more. Having had completed some small side projects and interning at some companies, I wanted a place to document the details of my past work. I thought that a blog is the perfect place for this.
The tech stack I used to set up this blog is quite straightforward. Hugo is the static site generator responsible for most of the heavy work, allowing me to write posts simply in Markdown.</description>
